# PWA Starter Kit for Firebase Enterprise usage

pwa-starter-kit is a _Polymer/LitElement_ project.

Any project that I would work on is going to need more than that. I'm going to need an auth and security layer, and lots more, too, before I can begin to do anything specific to the app itself.

PWASKFBEnterprise adds _firebase auth and JWT security_, ready for instantaneous deployment on _Firebase hosting_.

## Step by Step: For the 80%

For the 80% of corporate developers who are under-skilled in Polymer/Lit, Firebase, and even perhaps even JS, this project uses code in the public domain and modifies it in a youtube video so you can easily replicate it on your own.

Or, you can always start from any completed step by generating it in the yeoman generator.

## Usage: Start With the End In Mind:

An unprepared developer should still be able to get a secured and scalable app deployed by the end of the first day, or if he/she prefers, the first hour.

Straightaway, he is coding real functionality, not just fighting with the infrastructure, like I have been doing for the past year+.

## Usage: Step by Step, HowTo

One approach is to watch the youtube video playlist on double speed until you get to the step that you actually care about learning.

Then use the generator to create the previous step, and go slowly through the code in question until you grok that step.

## Vertical Stack, No Options

The top 20% of developers bristle at choices made for them and should stay away from this project for the most part.

"I prefer Mobx over Redux" or "Rollup sux, I need to use Parcel" or "I like the Vaadin Router better"

This project steers clear of anything but the most commonly used and/or canonical stacks and approaches that I can find in Winter of late 2018. Find good enough to clear the checklist and stop right there.

You can still sub your favorite stacks in, at any time.

## Winter 2018 Code

This project will probably be obsolete by mid 2019, because it is based on Nov/Dec 2018 code and practices.
